"Cal PERS","California Public Employees' Retirement System","CalPERS has long been a leader in sustainability and is committed to preserving our State’s natural resources. The data represented on this website reflects only part of our story and does not take into account that in 2003 CalPERS had only one property compared to four properties today, resulting in a 65% increase in total square footage.  Rather than using the “Total Energy Usage” comparison, a more appropriate method of comparison is “Energy Use Intensity” (EUI) which provides energy consumption per square foot.  This allows for a better means to measure the usage increase over 2003 based on the increase in the number of properties and related square footage.

CalPERS is a leader in addressing environmental issues.  We have made significant efforts to improve the environmental footprint of our properties.  For more information on our Green Building Accomplishments visit our <a href=""http://www.calpers.ca.gov/eip-docs/about/pubs/green-building-sustainability.pdf"">website </a>.  We have been recognized for our conservative efforts and commitment for being environmental stewards in sustainability:

• Our Lincoln Plaza East/West building was rated LEED® Certified Platinum by USGBC in May 2014, and the Lincoln Plaza North building was Certified Gold in August 2014. 
• In response to the Governor’s emergency water reduction declaration, CalPERS reduced water usage by 30% from Jan -  December 2014 (nearly 10 million gallons) compared to water usage in 2013 for the same months. 
• In November 2013, CalPERS was recognized for superior energy performance and received the Energy Star Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
• CalPERS is certified as a Climate Action Leader by the California Climate Action Registry for the commitment to managing GHG emissions.

"Cal STRS","California State Teachers' Retirement System","The California State Teachers’ Retirement System advances organizational sustainability practices that promote long-term value creation, responsible investment strategies, stewardship of our natural resources and engagement with our stakeholder community for the benefit of our members.  CalSTRS maintains a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum (LEED) certification for its West Sacramento headquarters. Energy efficient building features and environmental components such as a biofuel waste program, ongoing employee education, and a sustainability policy enable CalSTRS to address all sustainability issues including climate change at every facet of its business operations. 

CalSTRS recently expanded its member service to include three LEED-certified, leased-space facilities throughout the state with additional centers planned in the future. To offset increased emissions, CalSTRS has implemented several energy reduction strategies such as a retrofit of its headquarters garage with light emitting diode (LED) fixtures, increased focus of enterprise-wide energy use through employee engagement practices and building maintenance efforts. CalSTRS, through its business efforts and employee programs, seeks to reduce our impact on our environment and sustain the fund for the long-term. CalSTRS is the largest educator-only pension fund in the world and serves California’s 868,000 public school educators and their families from the state’s 1,600 school districts, county offices of education and community college districts.

"CALTECH","California Department of Technology","The Department of Technology’s (CalTech) Office of Technology Services (Otech) provides information technology services to many state, county, federal and local government entities throughout California. Through the use of a scalable, reliable and secure statewide network, combined with expertise in voice and data technologies, OTech delivers comprehensive, cost-effective computing, networking, electronic messaging and training solutions to benefit the people of California. 

As the state’s Information Technology (IT) leader, CalTech led efforts to reduce total state department IT energy equipment use by at least 20 percent, as required by Assembly Bill 2408 (Smyth and Huber, Chapter 404, Statutes of 2010). To meet required energy reductions, many state departments consolidated their IT equipment into CalTech’s LEED Gold certified and ENERGY STAR® rated data center, including equipment from two of OTech’s data centers, which were decommissioned in 2010. Although energy, water, and GHG emissions increased at CalTech’s state-owned data center as a result of these consolidation efforts, departmental totals from data center operations were significantly reduced. 

CalTech implemented significant energy and water efficiency strategies at its mission-critical, LEED Gold certified and ENERGY STAR® rated data center. These strategies included site-wide power, lighting, and computer room equipment mechanical upgrades and real-time cooling tower control and monitoring equipment installation. This strategic implementation reduced energy use at the data center by 1.7 million kilowatt-hours annually, equal to the energy used by 91 homes, and saves over a million gallons of water per year. Energy and water improvement initiatives, currently underway, include server virtualization through cloud computing, improved computer room cooling efficiencies, replacement of cooling towers with more energy-efficient models, Xeriscape landscaping  and solar panel installation in the parking lot.

"CDCR","California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation","The CDCR operates all state adult prisons and juvenile facilities, oversees a variety of community correctional facilities, and supervises all adult and juvenile offenders. The CDCR vision is to end the causes and tragic effects of crime, violence, and victimization in our communities through a collaborative effort that provides intervention to at-risk populations and quality services from the time of arrest that will assist our clients in achieving successful reintegration into society. The CDCR mission is to improve public safety through law enforcement that provides for the safe and secure incarceration of the State’s most serious and violent felons, in addition to provide parole supervision and develop and implement rehabilitative strategies to successfully reintegrate these offenders back into their communities.

ENERGY: Since 2008, in partnership with California’s utility companies, the CDCR has completed 84 energy efficiency projects utilizing Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) which have saved approximately 64 million kilowatt hours of electricity and over 2 million therms of natural gas. The incentives received for these projects total over $16.5 million and the annual utility bill savings are approximately $6.7 million. The CDCR has achieved a 14% reduction in energy use while also experiencing a 20% growth in total floor space since 2003. Some of the energy efficient measures include lighting retrofits and upgrades to LED, installing variable frequency drives on fans and motors, and replacing boilers and other inefficient mechanical equipment.

WATER: For the past decade, the CDCR has sought to conserve water through water efficiency measures including the installation of water restricting shower and toilet flushing control devices. In response to the current drought, the CDCR has instituted a Statewide Mandatory Drought Action Plan and each institution has designated a Water Conservation Manager and a Drought Task Force Team to implement site-specific Action Plans in order to reduce by 25% and higher for urban water suppliers identified by the State Water Board.  Measures include a prohibition of all landscape watering with potable water, limiting shower durations, a cessation of the State Vehicle Washing program, and education of staff and inmates. These efforts have reduced water consumption by 37% from 2003 to 2014. The 2014 savings over the previous year was 15%, and the current water savings since 2013 is 13%.

GHG EMISSIONS: Since 2010, CDCR energy efficiency projects and renewable solar projects have helped CDCR achieve a reduction in GHG emissions of over 54,000 metric tons of CO2e, which is a 12% reduction.  CDCR is also partnering with Cal Recycle to divert food waste from landfills which will contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions.

RENEWABLES: Since 2006, the CDCR has installed over 33.63 megawatts of solar photovoltaic arrays at 12 institutions and is currently collaborating with the Department of General Services to install an additional 34 megawatts of wind turbines and solar arrays. The current CDCR renewable portfolio accounts for approximately 10% of the Department’s total energy use.

"CLC","California Lottery Commission ","The Lottery was created by a ballot measure, Proposition 37, which was approved by 58 percent of voters on Nov. 6, 1984. The Lottery Act gave the Lottery a clear mission: to provide supplemental funding for public schools and colleges.  Since that time the Lottery has provided approximately 28 billion dollars in funds to public education.  

The Lottery’s property portfolio has grown substantially over the last 12 years and with it energy and water needs have increased.  In 2003, the California Lottery Commission (Lottery) owned one facility that housed its headquarters operations, Northern Distribution Center and Sacramento District Office.  Currently, the Lottery owns three individual properties resulting in a 18% increase in total square footage.

The Lottery is committed to sustainability and in July 2011 the Lottery moved into a new LEED® Certified Gold headquarters building and is in the process of obtaining LEED® certification for Existing Building (LEED® EB).  Additionally, the Lottery is taking steps for LEED® EB at our Northern Distribution Center.

Since May of 2014, the Lottery has made significant strides in reducing it water usage.  By identifying and resolving issues as well as taking a proactive approach, the Lottery reduced its water usage by 64% from May 2014 to January 2015.  The Lottery continues to monitor our water usage and pursue additional reduction options.

"CSC","California Science Center","The California Science Center aspires to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning in everyone by creating fun, memorable experiences, because we value science as an indispensable tool for understanding our world, accessibility and inclusiveness, and enriching people's lives.

Since 2003, the California Science Center has made numerous additions to its footprint in Exposition Park based on a 25-year, three-phase Master Plan.  At the end of 2003, a four-level underground parking structure was unveiled.  In 2004, the Amgen Center for Science Learning, the educational arm of the Science Center, opened a new educational facility, the Wallis Annenberg Building for Science Learning and Innovation, in the historical Armory Building.  In the fall of 2004, in partnership with the Science Center, Los Angeles Unified School District opened the Dr. Theodore T. Alexander Science Center School, a charter elementary school with over 690 students.  In 2010, the second phase of the Master Plan unveiled Ecosystems, the new permanent exhibition wing that nearly doubled the exhibition space in the Science Center featuring over 250 species of plants and animals and a 188,000-gallon kelp tank.  In 2012, the Samuel Oschin Pavilion was opened to temporarily exhibit the Space Shuttle Endeavour awarded by NASA.  The final phase of the Master Plan is the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center that will permanently house Endeavour in an approximately 185,000-square-foot expansion projected to open in 2018.  

The California Science Center’s water usage includes that used by the Office of Exposition Park Management and the California African-American Museum.  The California Science Center’s electricity usage includes that used by the Office of Exposition Park Management. The Science Center is currently involved in several major facility-wide projects that will reduce our future energy usage, GHGe, and water consumption.

DGS also leads the state in LEED certification efforts with more than half of its buildings LEED certified. 
In response to Governor Brown’s declaration of a drought in California, the Department of General Services (DGS) took a series of immediate and aggressive water conservation actions at state facilities. Water conservation measures initiated by DGS include: Cutting the amount of water used in landscaping, shutting off fountains and water features on state property instituting a moratorium on nonessential landscaping

"DWR","Department of Water Resources","The Department of Water Resources (DWR) is responsible for managing and protecting California’s water. DWR works with other agencies to benefit the state’s people, and to protect, restore and enhance the natural and human environments.

DWR’s increase in retail energy use is due to an unexpected catastrophic loss of one of its hydroelectric power plants in Nov. 2012.  Previously, the plant’s station load was provided by non-retail energy produced by the plant, and a small amount was provided by PG&E.  When the plant was shut down, the plant’s station load switched over to PG&E, which is now the sole source of  energy for on-going repair work to recover the plant.  The repair work is adding an average of 90,000 kWh per month of additional load to DWR’s retail energy usage.  When the repairs are complete, the plant’s station load will return to its non-retail source, and retail energy usage will return to normal.  DWR is uncertain if the repair work will be completed by 2018 at this time.
